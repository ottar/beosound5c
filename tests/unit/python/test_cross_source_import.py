"""Pin the fix from commits 7d3f282 / 84f9bb3.

Every source service used to have an ``auth.py`` and a ``tokens.py``
imported as top-level ``auth`` / ``tokens`` via ``sys.path.insert``.
At runtime each service runs in its own process so the collision never
fires, but the moment any test process imports two sources together
they fight over the same ``sys.modules`` entries.

This test imports every source service (and the player services) into
one process and asserts:

  1. All imports succeed.
  2. No two modules have the same short top-level name (so a future
     ``config.py`` or ``auth.py`` added to one source can't silently
     shadow another).

If this test fails because you added a new module named the same as an
existing one in a sibling source, rename it to a unique package-scoped
name (e.g. ``<source>_config.py``) per the 7d3f282 convention.

# Idempotent — safe to re-run any time the config changes:
#   - enables + starts the player + dependencies for player.type
#   - disables + stops the other player implementations
#   - enables + starts optional sources listed in the menu, disables others
#   - try-restarts running beo-* services so they pick up the new config
#
# Called by:
#   - install-services.sh (initial install / re-deploy)
#   - input.py:handle_config_save (config UI save → live switch)

# Individual start/stop failures must NOT abort the reconcile mid-way

#   REQUIRED_FAILED — the configured player and core-service restarts.
#     These failing means the device won't play; exit 1 so callers
#     (install-services.sh) see a real failure.
#   OPTIONAL_FAILED — menu-driven optional sources. Warn but exit 0 so
#     one broken optional source doesn't abort an install.
